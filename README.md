### What I learned

I learnt a couple of new properties working on this challenge like adding background blend modes in CSS, styling the page to responsive, how to to use CSS properties more effectively.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the Frontend Mentor Slack community for helping through the challenge. I remember getting started on the challenge and thinking it would be really easy to work on, but it was a bit more challenging than I thought. But I'm really happy I was able to complete the project because it definitely helped me build my knowledge of HTML and CSS.
